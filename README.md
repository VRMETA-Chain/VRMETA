Initial circulating supply: 50,000,000 for airdrops, investments, development.

# VRMETA Mining
Timestake Pallet - Players earn VRMETA and secure the network by mining VRMETA at a mathematical rate based on individual staking amounts,
time played, and overall total supply as follows (subject to change):

# VRMETAx721 
Cross-Chain NFT swap and management specialized for in-game, simultaneous multi-blockchain connections.
NFTs will be tradable in a multichain atmosphere by allocating NFTs and NFT types to a swapping pool, similar to Uniswap's ERC20 token pools.

# VRMETA Native Payment SDK
One of VRMETA's most important native applications will be the decentralized ability to buy VRMETA with credit cards or third party
payment apps anywhere in the world, then bridge to any network.  This is to eliminate the need to go through exchanges to get on-chain; 
users can now get on-chain directly.
